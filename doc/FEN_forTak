I'll adapt the chess FEN notation for tak as follow

Only the position description needs to be changed to record stacked stones
so rows will still be divided by '/', but each row will be as follows

/4(CfFfFFFFff)(F)(C)1/
an occupied square is represented between brackets and inside the stack is described
left to right as a FEN row
